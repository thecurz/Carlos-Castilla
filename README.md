# Hi there! :>

I'm Carlos, a Computer Science student from Peru. 
Here are some of my current interests:
- 🚀 TypeScript is currently my favorite language and the one I've used the most.
- 🌐 I really enjoy doing web development in my free time for my friends or in my personal projects.
- 📊 I've grown more and more interested in Data Science ever since I discovered programming (Python was my first programming language).
- 💻 Competitive Programming has always seemed really hard, but I'm trying my best to get good at it!
